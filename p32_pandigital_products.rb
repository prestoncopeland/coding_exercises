Problem 32: Pandigital Products

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

  array.slice(index, length).join.to_i
end

#determine if a permutation, entered as an array, is a pandigital identity. There are two possibilities based on 9 digits: either the multiplicand has one digit, the multiplier has four, and the product has four, or the multiplicand has two digits, the multiplier has three, and the product has four.
